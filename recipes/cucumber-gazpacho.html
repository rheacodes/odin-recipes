            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This summer-ready gazpacho tastes cucumber-forward with an underlying sweetness from the honeydew and honey, and the sherry vinegar sharpens those flavors. Serve with delicate-tasting seafood such as crab, soft herbs, a yogurt drizzle, or olive oil-toasted bread cubes.</p>

        <div class="rcp-ingredients">
           <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 large English cucumbers</li>
                <li>3 cups chopped honeydew melon</li>
                <li>1 cup cubed crustless day-old white bread</li>
                <li>1/4 cup olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sherry vinegar</li>
                <li>2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="rcp-steps">
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Thinly slice one of the cucumbers to equal 1/3 cup. Transfer cucumber slices to a small bowl; cover and chill until ready to use.</li>
                <li>Coarsely chop remaining cucumbers and transfer to a blender. Add honeydew, bread cubes, 1/4 cup oil, vinegar, and 2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt. Process on low speed, gradually increasing speed to high, until cucumber mixture is very smooth and creamy, about 90 seconds.</li>
                <li>Pour gazpacho into a medium bowl. Cover and chill until cold, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Right before serving, toss together reserved cucumber slices, feta cheese, mint, honey, and a pinch of salt in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Stir and ladle gazpacho into 4 shallow bowls. Top evenly with cucumber-feta mixture and drizzle with olive oil.</li>
            </ol>
